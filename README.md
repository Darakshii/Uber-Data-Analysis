## Overview of the Data
Daily Uber provides the 2012 data. By using this data we are going to find out the demand and supply Analysis gap of the cab. We have some data dictionary as follows-
1. App Openings (Eyeballs) = Customers who launch the app looking for riders. It is a good measure of demand
2. Zeroes = Customers who open the app and see no cars in the area.
3. Request = Customers who make requests for a car.
4. Completed Trip = The point from when a customer is picked.

## Trends
Upon further analysis, it is found that in the span of two weeks 27% customer opens the app and not getting ride. Also demand for ride is more than the drivers available.

## Insights
1. Around 26% of customer found no cars available during Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
2. It is found that, in weekends around 170- 190 requests were seen within 16PM-24AM.
3. Very few people are asking for ride during 2AM-4AM, so we can call it as least rush hours.

## Summary
The report analyses rush hours, non-rush hours, Total Completed Trips, Daily/Hourly demand for rides and also availability for rides.

## Recommendation
It is found, that there is high demand and very less drivers are available during 11PM-12AM, So it is feasible to make drivers available in this period this can be done by providing some charges to the drivers etc. 
Also daily demand for rides are more and drivers available are less, so new drivers must be hired.
At midnight (2AM-4AM) there are very few requests arises, and within 4PM-12AM high demand for drivers are observed, so we can accordingly increase and decrease no. of available drivers in this period, this can be done by introducing various offers for the driver in that particular period.
